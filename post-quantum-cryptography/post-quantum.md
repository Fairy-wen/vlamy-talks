### Formalized RSA problem
  If an attacker can retrieve `p` and `q` from `n`, then she can retrieve `e` and `sk`

### Difficulty
  It takes around 1000 core-years to factorize RSA-768 (record), with a classical computer.

The LWE assumption states that it is hard to distinguish
from uniform the distribution (A, As + e), where A is a uniformly-random matrix in Zm√ón, s is a uniformly-random
vector in Zq , and e is a vector with random ‚Äúsmall‚Äù coefficients chosen from some distribution

# Kyber - resources - LWE on module lattice

## Learning With Errors (LWE)
The design of Kyber has its roots in the seminal LWE-based encryption scheme of Regev. Since Regev's original work, the practical efficiency of LWE encryption schemes has been improved by observing that the secret in LWE can come from the same distribution as the noise and also noticing that "LWE-like" schemes can be built by using a square (rather than a rectangular) matrix as the public key. Another improvement was applying an idea originally used in the NTRU cryptosystem to define the Ring-LWE and Module-LWE problems that used polynomial rings rather than integers. The CCA-secure KEM Kyber is built on top of a CPA-secure cryptosystem that is based on the hardness of Module-LWE.
